# Contribution Guidelines

## TODO

## Pull Requests

* Fill in [the required template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
* Include one feature/bug fix per Pull Request.  Multiple issues in one PR can increase the complexity of the review and could delay the merging of your code.
* Maintain the formatting (specifically white spacing) in the files you are modifying
* Reference the Issue number in the PR if there's a related issue
* If you are adding new APIs or changing behavior, include entries in the README.md so new users know how to interact with the new features.  We want everyone to use your work!

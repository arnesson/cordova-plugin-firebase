 *
 * In the updateBlock, a set of reads and writes can be performed atomically using the
 * `FIRTransaction` object passed to the block. After the updateBlock is run, Firestore will attempt
 * to apply the changes to the server. If any of the data read has been modified outside of this
 * transaction since being read, then the transaction will be retried by executing the updateBlock
 * again. If the transaction still fails after 5 retries, then the transaction will fail.
 *
 * Since the updateBlock may be executed multiple times, it should avoiding doing anything that
 * would cause side effects.
 *
 * Any value maybe be returned from the updateBlock. If the transaction is successfully committed,
 * then the completion block will be passed that value. The updateBlock also has an `NSError` out
 * parameter. If this is set, then the transaction will not attempt to commit, and the given error
 * will be passed to the completion block.
 *
 * The `FIRTransaction` object passed to the updateBlock contains methods for accessing documents
 * and collections. Unlike other firestore access, data accessed with the transaction will not
 * reflect local changes that have not been committed. For this reason, it is required that all
 * reads are performed before any writes. Transactions must be performed while online. Otherwise,
 * reads will fail, the final commit will fail, and the completion block will return an error.
 *
 * @param updateBlock The block to execute within the transaction context.
 * @param completion The block to call with the result or error of the transaction. This
 *     block will run even if the client is offline, unless the process is killed.

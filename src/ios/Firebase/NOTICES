sqlite3
2001 September 15

The author disclaims copyright to this source code.  In place of
a legal notice, here is a blessing:

 May you do good and not evil.
 May you find forgiveness for yourself and forgive others.
 May you share freely, never taking more than you give.


This header file defines the interface that the SQLite library
presents to client programs.  If a C-function, structure, datatype,
or constant definition does not appear in this file, then it is
not a published API of SQLite, is subject to change without
notice, and should not be referenced by programs that use SQLite.

Some of the definitions that are in this file are marked as
"experimental".  Experimental interfaces are normally new
features recently added to SQLite.  We do not anticipate changes
to experimental interfaces but reserve the right to make minor changes
if experience from use "in the wild" suggest such changes are prudent.

The official C-language API documentation for SQLite is derived
from comments in this file.  This file is the authoritative source
on how SQLite interfaces are suppose to operate.

The name of this file under configuration management is "sqlite.h.in".
The makefile makes some minor changes to this file (such as inserting
the version number) and changes its name to "sqlite3.h" as
part of the build process.

Comment from <a href="http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Crack_prevention">iPhone Dev Wiki
Crack Prevention</a>:
App Store binaries are signed by both their developer and Apple. This encrypts the binary so
that decryption keys are needed in order to make the binary readable. When iOS executes the
binary, the decryption keys are used to decrypt the binary into a readable state where it is
then loaded into memory and executed. iOS can tell the encryption status of a binary via the
cryptid structure member of LC_ENCRYPTION_INFO MachO load command. If cryptid is a non-zero
value then the binary is encrypted.
'Cracking' works by letting the kernel decrypt the binary then siphoning the decrypted data into
a new binary file, resigning, and repackaging. This will only work on jailbroken devices as
codesignature validation has been removed. Resigning takes place because while the codesignature
doesn't have to be valid thanks to the jailbreak, it does have to be in place unless you have
AppSync or similar to disable codesignature checks.

# We are moving & merging ...

Since the breaking change released by Google Firebase on Jun 17th, 2019, [we](https://www.wizpanda.com) have been maintaining this 
repository. From the same time, another guy [Dave Alden](https://github.com/dpa99c) from somewhere in the world ðŸ˜„ is also maintaining 
his fork https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-plugin-firebasex. 

Intention of both of us are same i.e. **to give back to the open-source community** and help developers of Cordova & Ionic frameworks so 
that they can use the Google Firebase in their applications without a hitch. So both the repositories were being updated regularly and 
new releases were being made.

This good though by both [Wiz Panda](https://www.wizpanda.com) & Dave resulted in developers of Cordova & Ionic getting confused & 
diverted to two different repositories which will become a mess in the future. To prevent this, we discussed this in a
[thread](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-plugin-firebasex/issues/47) raised by [hugoblanc](https://github.com/hugoblanc) and we all 
together decided to archive this repository and divert the developers to Dave's fork.

Dave has been quite active on his fork and he is doing a great job updating & improving the native codebase and documentations so:

## Requesting all the developers to start using [dpa99c/cordova-plugin-firebasex](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-plugin-firebasex) instead of this repository.

One can still use the last version of this plugin i.e. `v5.1.1` and checkout the code at commit/tag
https://github.com/wizpanda/cordova-plugin-firebase-lib/tree/v5.1.1 but please note, **no further updates, improvements will be made to 
this repository. No PR will be accepted.**

# Version 3.0.3
* Implement didReceiveRegistrationToken delegate for iOS. Resolves [#16](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-plugin-firebasex/issues/16).
* Document dependency on Cocoapods. Resolves [#15](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-plugin-firebasex/issues/15).
* Make min iOS version configurable. Resolves [#14](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-plugin-firebasex/issues/14).


# Version 3.0.2
* Update legacy Xpath reference to `<application>` element in `AndroidManifest.xml`

# Version 3.0.1
* Bump default iOS Firebase SDK version to 5.20.2 (https://firebase.google.com/support/release-notes/ios#version_5202_-_april_10_2019). Resolves [#8](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-plugin-firebasex/issues/8).

# Version 3.0.0
* Reapply: Support user-overriding of default Android Gradle & iOS Cocoapods versions using plugin variables.

# Version 2.1.2
* Revert: Support user-overriding of default Android Gradle & iOS Cocoapods versions using plugin variables.
    * Since it's not working on iOS due to Cocoapods plugin dependency.
    * Need to fix that plugin to handle plugin variables then reinstate this change in a major version release.

# Version 2.1.1
* Support user-overriding of default Android Gradle & iOS Cocoapods versions using plugin variables.

# Version 2.1.0
* Update Android source to use AndroidX class names and adds dependency on [cordova-plugin-androidx](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-plugin-androidx) for forward compatibility with future versions of Firebase libraries on Android.
    * Note: if you include other plugins in your project which reference the legacy Android Support Library, you'll still need to include [cordova-plugin-androidx-adapter](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-plugin-androidx-adapter) in your project to dynamically patch them.
* Pins Firebase and Crashlytics Gradle dependencies to latest major version (to prevent build failures due to unexpected changes in subsequent major versions).
* Set minimum supported versions to `cordova@8+`, `cordova-android@8+`, `cordova-ios@4+`.

# Version 2.0.7
* Merge [PR #7](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-plugin-firebasex/pull/7): use `<pod>` instead of deprecated `<<framework type="podspec">`. Resolves [#5](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-plugin-firebasex/issues/5).

# Version 2.0.6
* Use Cocoapods to satisfy iOS Firebase SDK (rather than bundling with plugin). See https://github.com/arnesson/cordova-plugin-firebase/pull/972.
* Add support for logMessage() and sendCrash() functions (ported from cordova-fabric-plugin)
* Bump version of Crashlytics library on Android to current latest (v2.9.8 - Dec 2018)
* Bump Firebase SDK versions in iOS PodSpecs to latest version (v5.15.0)
* Remove redundant build-extras.gradle
* Set minimum iOS version to 9.0 in podspec
* Remove unnecessary extra <config-file> block which can lead to race condition
* Fixes issues cause by Firebase SDK updates on 5 April 2019 (https://firebase.google.com/support/release-notes/android#update_-_april_05_2019) which removed deprecated API features causing Android build failures.
See https://github.com/arnesson/cordov 
* Fix compatibility with cordova@9 CLI
* Add explicit dependency on cordova-lib to prevent build error on iOS. Fixes #2.
